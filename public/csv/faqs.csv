"Why am I so thirsty?","The volume of blood in your body is increasing and this can make you feel thirstier than usual. Aim to drink eight medium glasses of fluid a day (sip if you are feeling sick)."
"Why am I always urinating?","You may notice that you need to wee more often. This often starts in early pregnancy thanks to hormones and continues as your growing womb presses on your bladder."
"Should I exercise?","Staying active while youâ€™re pregnant is great for both you and your baby. It can help with the tiredness and has a host of other benefits.  The amount of exercise you can do during pregnancy will depend on how active you were before you got pregnant."
"This is a new one","Of course it is brand new"
